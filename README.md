## ETFs

The ETF issuers with the largest total assets under management are BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Street (in decreasing order). The [ETF database](https://etfdb.com/etfs/issuers/#issuer-power-rankings__aum&sort_name=revenue_position&sort_order=asc&page=1) is a great resource for comparing and searching for ETFs. Three tables below show allocations using ETFs from these institutions. Regardless of your choice, the fees are a matter of cents annually for every $100 invested.

## Mutual funds

The leading providers of indexed mutual funds are Fidelity and Vanguard. There are no mutual fund offerings for the quality factor, nor for the international small cap value index, so those categories are omitted here. As with the ETFs above, annual fees are pennies per year for every $100 invested.

## General comments

Although the funds are presented as groups, there is no prize for brand loyalty and you may want to choose a combination of managing institutions. Others I haven’t mentioned have solid offerings which are not diverse enough to build a complex portfolio, as defined here. Schwab is included in the [next section's](https://github.com/investindex/Summary) summary table because it is one example of this. The fund [JQUA](https://am.jpmorgan.com/us/en/asset-management/adv/products/jpmorgan-us-quality-factor-etf-46641q761) mentioned below is a good product, but I cannot recommend many of J.P. Morgan’s other funds. Other institutions have still more offerings, so this guide is not exhaustive. But the institutions reviewed here manage many of the best funds at very low cost. So unless you have highly specific ideas beyond indexing and want to use a product like Invesco’s [Solar ETF](https://www.invesco.com/us/financial-products/etfs/product-detail?audienceType=Investor&ticker=TAN), you are not missing anything major by selecting among them.



## Comments on minor details

Vanguard’s US quality factor ETF (VFQY) is more balanced between small, mid, and large cap stocks than its counterpart at BlackRock (QUAL), which holds a smaller number of almost entirely large cap stocks. J.P. Morgan has a quality factor ETF with intermediate characteristics ([JQUA](https://am.jpmorgan.com/us/en/asset-management/adv/products/jpmorgan-us-quality-factor-etf-46641q761)).

State Street doesn’t offer an ETF focused solely on the quality factor, but it does offer multiple ETFs such as [QUS](https://www.ssga.com/us/en/individual/etfs/funds/spdr-msci-usa-strategicfactorssm-etf-qus), [QEFA](https://www.ssga.com/us/en/individual/etfs/funds/spdr-msci-eafe-strategicfactorssm-etf-qefa), and [QWLD](https://www.ssga.com/us/en/individual/etfs/funds/spdr-msci-world-strategicfactorssm-etf-qwld) with a combination of quality, value, and low volatility.

Fidelity lacks a low-cost global mutual fund, leading to the empty space in the first mutual fund table. BlackRock has ETF offerings for all categories, while those from Vanguard and State Street need to be supplemented with AVDV by Avantis or ISVL by BlackRock for the international small cap value category. Only BlackRock’s IVLU and Fidelity’s [FIVA](https://institutional.fidelity.com/app/fund/etf/snapshot/FIIS_ETF_FIVA.html) fit the international large cap value category, and BlackRock’s IQLT is the only one of its kind I am aware of.

One may wish to build a bespoke allocation of developed and emerging markets. This is not hard: ETF pairs for developed/emerging markets include [VEA](https://investor.vanguard.com/etf/profile/overview/VEA)/[VWO](https://investor.vanguard.com/etf/profile/VWO) by Vanguard, [IDEV](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/286762/ishares-core-msci-international-developed-markets-etf-fund)/[IEMG](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/244050/ishares-core-msci-emerging-markets-etf) by BlackRock, and [SPDW](https://www.ssga.com/us/en/individual/etfs/funds/spdr-portfolio-developed-world-ex-us-etf-spdw)/[SPEM](https://www.ssga.com/us/en/individual/etfs/funds/spdr-portfolio-emerging-markets-etf-spem) by State Street. (The fees are notably lower for these two from State Street than for CWI.) The mutual fund pairs are [FSPSX](https://fundresearch.fidelity.com/mutual-funds/summary/315911727)/[FPADX](https://fundresearch.fidelity.com/mutual-funds/summary/316146331) and [VTMGX](https://investor.vanguard.com/mutual-funds/profile/VTMGX)/[VEMAX](https://investor.vanguard.com/mutual-funds/profile/VEMAX).

Keep in mind that: (1) if a primary concern is market cap weighting, developed markets are a larger class and (even without the US) demand two to three times more weight than emerging markets; (2) the international value ETFs — AVDV, ISVL, IVLU, FIVA — invest exclusively in developed countries; and (3) emerging markets [do not always permit](https://www.fidelity.com/learning-center/investment-products/etf/etfs-tax-efficiency) the same tax efficiency for ETFs as other indices do, so they are more suitable for tax-advantaged investing. Unlike the international value ETFs, VTRIX provides some coverage of emerging markets.
