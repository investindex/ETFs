# Fund proposals

For ETFs and mutual funds separately, I will propose portfolios with increasing levels of complexity and provide options from multiple institutions. If an institution lacks a fund to fill a given row's category, it will either be left blank or filled in with a suggested fund from another institution. The simplest portfolios are a single fund: a total global fund or a total US fund. [Summary tables](https://github.com/investindex/Funds#summary) at the end organize all the funds, followed by an [example portfolio](https://github.com/investindex/Funds#example-portfolio) of specific stock and bond funds.

A terminology note: when used here in reference to a fund, the term _Global_ includes the US. The term _International_, abbreviated _Intl_, excludes the US.

&nbsp;

## ETFs

The ETF issuers with the largest total [assets under management](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/aum.asp) are BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Street (in decreasing order). The [ETF database](https://etfdb.com/etfs/issuers/#issuer-power-rankings__aum&sort_name=revenue_position&sort_order=asc&page=1) and [ETF.com](https://www.etf.com/channels/) are great resources for comparing and searching for ETFs. Regardless of your choice, the fees are a matter of cents annually for every $100 invested.

## Mutual funds

The leading providers of indexed mutual funds are Fidelity and Vanguard; Schwab has a smaller collection but also covers some indices which the first two do not (see RAFI indices in the [previous section](https://github.com/investindex/Portfolio)). Mutual fund offerings are not as diverse, so even the complex portfolio is not as complex as the ETF version. As with ETFs, annual fees are pennies per year for every $100 invested.

## General comments

Although the funds are presented as groups, there is no prize for brand loyalty and you may want to choose a combination of managing institutions, as well as a combination of ETFs and mutual funds. Other institutions I haven’t mentioned have solid offerings which are not diverse enough to build a complex portfolio at low cost, as defined here. So this guide is not exhaustive. But the institutions reviewed here manage many of the best funds at very low cost. Unless you have highly specific ideas beyond indexing, you are not missing anything major by selecting among them.

I will restate that some of these portfolios, like the simple and complex ETF portfolios, are highly factor-tilted. Investors who are concerned with not straying too far from standard market returns should include a significant allocation to a total market fund or large cap fund (which are very similar because the cap-weighted total market is dominated by large cap stocks). Examples of US large cap funds are in the summary table. They could also hold [RAFI funds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00ZACmAdi7g&ab_channel=TheRationalReminderPodcast), which are value-tilted but not as strongly as a value fund because they hold growth stocks as well (while underweighting them). RAFI funds are offered by Schwab, Invesco, and Pimco, as discussed below.

See this footnote<sup id="fn1">[1](#f1)</sup> for comments on minor details of funds, as well as many additional funds. Some of the new funds mentioned are multifactor funds, which combine the implementation of several factors in one fund.

Three of the emptiest stock fund rows are US Quality, Intl Quality, and Intl Small Cap Value. There are additional US Quality funds managed by Invesco ([SPHQ](https://www.invesco.com/us/financial-products/etfs/product-detail?audienceType=Investor&ticker=SPHQ)/[XMHQ](https://www.invesco.com/us/financial-products/etfs/product-detail?audienceType=Investor&ticker=XMHQ)/[XSHQ](https://www.invesco.com/us/financial-products/etfs/product-detail?audienceType=Investor&ticker=XSHQ)) and J.P. Morgan ([JQUA](https://am.jpmorgan.com/us/en/asset-management/adv/products/jpmorgan-us-quality-factor-etf-46641q761)); an Intl Quality fund managed by Invesco ([IDHQ](https://www.invesco.com/us/financial-products/etfs/product-detail?audienceType=Investor&ticker=IDHQ)); and Intl Small Cap Value funds managed by Avantis ([AVDV](https://www.avantisinvestors.com/content/avantis/en/investments/avantis-international-small-cap-value-etf.html)) and Invesco ([PDN](https://www.invesco.com/us/financial-products/etfs/product-detail?audienceType=Investor&ticker=PDN)). PDN actually invests in both small and mid cap stocks, which is valuable because no other fund offers exposure to mid cap equity in developed markets. It provides value tilt through RAFI weighting. However, its expense ratio is somewhat high for developed markets at .49%.

Some Schwab funds don't fit neatly into the summary table: their RAFI total US ETF ([FNDB](https://www.schwabassetmanagement.com/products/fndb)), RAFI US large cap funds ([FNDX](https://www.schwabassetmanagement.com/products/fndx)/[SFLNX](https://www.schwabassetmanagement.com/products/sflnx)), and RAFI emerging markets funds ([FNDE](https://www.schwabassetmanagement.com/products/fnde)/[SFENX](https://www.schwabassetmanagement.com/products/sfenx)). And in addition to the Schwab 1000 funds included in the table ([SCHK](https://www.schwabassetmanagement.com/products/schk)/[SNXFX](https://www.schwabassetmanagement.com/products/snxfx)), which hold the 1000 largest US companies, Schwab manages a large cap ETF which holds the 750 largest US companies ([SCHX](https://www.schwabassetmanagement.com/products/schx)).

Bond funds that did not fit in the summary table are: BlackRock's short-term, high-yield bond fund ([SHYG](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/258100/ishares-05-year-high-yield-corporate-bond-etf)), State Street's ultrashort-term US treasury bond fund ([BILS](https://www.ssga.com/us/en/individual/etfs/funds/spdr-bloomberg-barclays-3-12-month-t-bill-etf-bils)), Avantis's aggregate US bond fund ([AVIG](https://www.avantisinvestors.com/content/avantis/en/investments/avantis-core-fixed-income-etf.html)) and short-term bond fund ([AVSF](https://www.avantisinvestors.com/content/avantis/en/investments/avantis-short-term-fixed-income-etf.html)), and Invesco's aggregate US bond fund ([PBND](https://www.invesco.com/us/financial-products/etfs/product-detail?audienceType=Investor&ticker=PBND)) and ultrashort-term US treasury bond fund ([CLTL](https://www.invesco.com/us/financial-products/etfs/product-detail?audienceType=Investor&ticker=CLTL)). Some of the Vanguard bond ETFs have a mutual fund counterpart with a purchase fee (also known as a front-end load). Those mutual funds are excluded for that reason; other Vanguard bond ETFs lack a mutual fund counterpart.

There are also the all-in-one funds [discussed in the guidelines](https://github.com/investindex/Guidelines#simplify-dont-oversimplify) and the additional funds discussed in the footnote.

## Example portfolio

These examples are for a hypothetical married couple, both age 35 and earning income, who rent their residence and have no debt. Their combined liquid net worth is $40,000 plus $10,000 in a Roth IRA one of them has contributed to. In the complex versions, they keep $20,000 in cash and bonds and the remainder in stocks. Some indices are duplicated, because their taxable brokerage account and Roth IRA must be separate. In the simple version, they keep about $20,800 in cash and bonds and the remainder in stocks. Only three funds are used, instead of 13 (A) or 15 (B). They approach two poles of a spectrum of complexity; many people would choose an intermediate number of funds.

#### Additional funds and minor comments<sup id="f1"> 1 </sup>

If the funds listed here present an overwhelming number of choices, then ignore them and keep reading.

Three important fund managers not yet given much or any attention are Avantis, Dimensional, and Alpha Architect. Products from Dimensional Fund Advisors (DFA) were accessible only to those who used wealth management firms for about 40 years, until DFA began listing ETFs in November 2020. [Their ETF offerings](https://us.dimensional.com/etfs) are not yet as extensive as their mutual funds, but they continue to list more as recently as September 2021. Their funds are among the best. Ben Felix, a portfolio manager at PWL Capital, has a [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/BenFelixCSI/videos) and [podcast](https://www.youtube.com/c/RATIONALREMINDER/videos) in which he often explains the value of applying academic research in fund management. PWL Capital uses DFA mutual funds for their clients.

Avantis is a recently founded asset manager run by former DFA employees. [Their funds](https://www.avantisinvestors.com/content/avantis/en/investments.html) are also of the highest quality, and for now they offer a greater number of publicly accessible funds. Their US small cap value ETF ([AVUV](https://www.avantisinvestors.com/content/avantis/en/investments/avantis-u-s-small-cap-value-etf.html)) is an example of a superlative product that I would probably favor over any other. (VIOV, IJS, and SLYV are good too; they track the same index which, importantly, screens for profitability.) Avantis offers bond funds, and they distinguish themselves by using information in the current [yield curve](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/y/yieldcurve.asp) to enhance returns. This approach is explained in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toUmwo-mhjM&ab_channel=TheRationalReminderPodcast).

Importantly, funds managed by DFA and Avantis are not index funds. They are influenced by rules, like index funds, but are not required to rebalance or reconstitute during short periods like many index funds managed by Vanguard or BlackRock. As explained [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0RSFpUpovI&t=2627s&ab_channel=StrategicAnalysisCapitalManagement) by an Avantis manager, the obligation to rebalance quickly on a pre-set schedule can create liquidity issues and lead to high trading costs. If managers have the flexibility to wait for liquidity and better prices, they are able to trade in a way that produces better long-term returns. Their investment strategies can't be summarized in a simple title, so be sure to read the prospectus to fully understand the fund's strategies. You should always do this anyway, but it is especially important when the fund manager has significant flexibility.

Alpha Architect is a smaller manager that develops [focused factor ETFs](https://etfsite.alphaarchitect.com). They create concentrated portfolios based on quantitative rules that seek to maximize the higher expected returns of factors like value. If you want to make an especially strong bet on value, probably with a small fraction of your portfolio, using ETFs like QVAL and IVAL is a way to do it. [This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kldNkfPBCBk&ab_channel=TheRationalReminderPodcast) is a great explanation of the firm's ideas by its founder, Wes Gray. BlackRock does have one product like this ([FOVL](https://www.blackrock.com/us/individual/products/307330/ishares-focused-value-factor-etf)), although it appears to lack the strong filter for profitability that makes Alpha Architect products highly attractive.

&nbsp;

Invesco has been briefly mentioned, but it offers many products not available from the behemoths. One category is their equal-weighted funds. They have an equal-weighted small cap fund with the S&P 600 ([EWSC](https://www.invesco.com/us/financial-products/etfs/product-detail?audienceType=Investor&ticker=EWSC)), an equal-weighted mid cap fund with the S&P 400 ([EWMC](https://www.invesco.com/us/financial-products/etfs/product-detail?audienceType=Investor&ticker=EWMC)), and an equal-weighted large cap fund with the S&P 500 ([RSP](https://www.invesco.com/us/financial-products/etfs/product-detail?audienceType=Investor&ticker=RSP)). They also have an equal-weighted Russell 1000 fund ([EQAL](https://www.invesco.com/us/financial-products/etfs/product-detail?audienceType=Investor&ticker=EQAL)), but unlike the other funds it weights equally within sectors. As Rob Arnott discusses [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00ZACmAdi7g&ab_channel=TheRationalReminderPodcast), equal weighting is one way to break the link with price (the darts he refers to are actual darts, meaning selecting stocks randomly).

Invesco also offers small ([RZV](https://www.invesco.com/us/financial-products/etfs/product-detail?audienceType=Investor&ticker=RZV)), mid ([RFV](https://www.invesco.com/us/financial-products/etfs/product-detail?audienceType=Investor&ticker=RFV)), and large ([RPV](https://www.invesco.com/us/financial-products/etfs/product-detail?audienceType=Investor&ticker=RPV)) cap US funds with very strong value tilts.

&nbsp;

When deciding on weights for developed vs. emerging markets, keep in mind that: (1) if a primary concern is market cap weighting, developed markets are a larger class and (even without the US) demand two to three times more weight than emerging markets; and (2) all the international single-factor funds invest exclusively in developed countries, except VTRIX which provides some coverage of emerging markets as well.

There are two ETFs for small cap stocks in emerging markets, [EEMS](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/239642/ishares-msci-emerging-markets-smallcap-etf) and [EWX](https://www.ssga.com/us/en/individual/etfs/funds/spdr-sp-emerging-markets-small-cap-etf-ewx). Without a filter for value or profitability, their high expense ratios suggest that these funds are not worth including at this time.

BlackRock has an alternative to IUSV. This fund, [VLUE](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/251616/ishares-msci-usa-value-factor-etf), has a smaller number of holdings and a stronger value tilt than IUSV. It is expected to exaggerate the value premium, so it stands to reason that in the long run VLUE will probably outperform IUSV, with the drawback of higher volatility and higher random risk due to less diversification.

&nbsp;

#### Multifactor funds

State Street doesn’t offer an ETF focused solely on the quality factor, but it does offer multiple ETFs with a combination of quality, value, and low volatility: [QUS](https://www.ssga.com/us/en/individual/etfs/funds/spdr-msci-usa-strategicfactorssm-etf-qus), [QEFA](https://www.ssga.com/us/en/individual/etfs/funds/spdr-msci-eafe-strategicfactorssm-etf-qefa), [QEMM](https://www.ssga.com/us/en/individual/etfs/funds/spdr-msci-emerging-markets-strategicfactorssm-etf-qemm), and [QWLD](https://www.ssga.com/us/en/individual/etfs/funds/spdr-msci-world-strategicfactorssm-etf-qwld). Low volatility is advertised because it has strong historical returns, but these returns are explained by [other](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUbJ21WcUWA&ab_channel=BenFelix) [variables](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X21002051). A low-volatility strategy dovetails well with selecting high-profitability stocks.

There are other [multifactor funds](https://www.msci.com/msci-diversified-multi-factor-indexes) which I will list here. You might consider using these funds to achieve risk factor diversification more simply, although the methods of diversification are less clear than when implemented on your own. Expense ratios are slightly higher but still reasonable.

Vanguard manages a rules-based US multifactor fund ([VFMF](https://investor.vanguard.com/etf/profile/VFMF)).

BlackRock manages a global multifactor fund ([ACWF](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/272821/ishares-msci-global-multi-factor-etf)), a developed markets multifactor fund ([INTF](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/272822/ishares-msci-international-multi-factor-etf)), an emerging markets multifactor fund ([EMGF](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/272820/ishares-msci-emerging-multi-factor-etf)), an international developed small cap multifactor fund ([ISCF](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/272823/ishares-msci-international-small-cap-multi-factor-etf)), a US small cap multifactor fund ([SMLF](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/272825/ishares-msci-usa-small-cap-multi-factor-etf)), a US mid cap multifactor fund ([MIDF](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/308876/)), and a US large cap multifactor fund ([LRGF](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/272824/ishares-msci-usa-multi-factor-etf)).

Pimco manages a RAFI US multifactor fund ([MFUS](https://www.pimco.com/en-us/investments/etf/rafi-dynamic-multi-factor-us-equity-etf)), a RAFI developed markets multifactor fund ([MFDX](https://www.pimco.com/en-us/investments/etf/rafi-dynamic-multi-factor-international-equity-etf)), and a RAFI emerging markets multifactor fund ([MFEM](https://www.pimco.com/en-us/investments/etf/rafi-dynamic-multi-factor-emerging-markets-equity-etf)).

Goldman Sachs manages a US large cap multifactor fund ([GSLC](https://www.gsam.com/content/gsam/us/en/individual/products/etf-fund-finder/goldman-sachs-activebeta-u-s--large-cap-equity-etf.html)), a US small cap multifactor fund ([GSSC](https://www.gsam.com/content/gsam/us/en/advisors/fund-center/etf-fund-finder/goldman-sachs-activebeta-u-s--small-cap-equity-etf.html)), a developed markets multifactor fund ([GSIE](https://www.gsam.com/content/gsam/us/en/individual/products/etf-fund-finder/goldman-sachs-activebeta-international-equity-etf.html)), and an emerging markets multifactor fund ([GEM](https://www.gsam.com/content/gsam/us/en/individual/products/etf-fund-finder/goldman-sachs-activebeta-emerging-markets-equity-etf.html)). Despite the ActiveBeta label, they are passively managed like all funds discussed here.

Invesco manages a US large cap multifactor fund ([QVML](https://www.invesco.com/us/financial-products/etfs/product-detail?audienceType=Investor&productId=ETF-QVML)), a US mid cap multifactor fund ([QVMM](https://www.invesco.com/us/financial-products/etfs/product-detail?audienceType=Investor&productId=ETF-QVMM)), and a US small cap multifactor fund ([QVMS](https://www.invesco.com/us/financial-products/etfs/product-detail?audienceType=Investor&productId=ETF-QVMS)).

Fidelity manages a developed markets multifactor fund ([FDEV](https://institutional.fidelity.com/app/fund/etf/snapshot/FIIS_ETF_FDEV.html)), an emerging markets multifactor fund ([FDEM](https://institutional.fidelity.com/app/fund/etf/snapshot/FIIS_ETF_FDEM.html)), a US large cap multifactor fund ([FLRG](https://institutional.fidelity.com/app/fund/etf/snapshot/FIIS_ETF_FLRG.html)), and a US small/mid cap multifactor fund ([FSMD](https://institutional.fidelity.com/app/fund/etf/snapshot/FIIS_ETF_FSMD.html)).
