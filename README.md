# Fund proposals

For ETFs and mutual funds separately, I will propose portfolios with increasing levels of complexity. If an institution lacks a fund to fill a given row's category, it will either be left blank or filled in with a suggested fund from another institution. The simplest portfolios are a single fund, but two options are provided: a total US fund or a total global fund. Summary tables at the end organize all the funds, and this is followed by an example portfolio.

A terminology note: when used here in reference to a fund, the term _Global_ includes the US. The term _International_, abbreviated _Intl_, excludes the US.

&nbsp;

## ETFs

The ETF issuers with the largest total assets under management are BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Street (in decreasing order). The [ETF database](https://etfdb.com/etfs/issuers/#issuer-power-rankings__aum&sort_name=revenue_position&sort_order=asc&page=1) is a great resource for comparing and searching for ETFs. Regardless of your choice, the fees are a matter of cents annually for every $100 invested.

## Mutual funds

The leading providers of indexed mutual funds are Fidelity and Vanguard; Schwab has a smaller collection but also covers some indices which the first two do not (see the [previous section](https://github.com/investindex/Portfolio)). There are no mutual fund offerings for the domestic or international quality factor, so those categories are omitted here. As with the ETFs above, annual fees are pennies per year for every $100 invested.

## General comments

Although the funds are presented as groups, there is no prize for brand loyalty and you may want to choose a combination of managing institutions. Others I haven’t mentioned have solid offerings which are not diverse enough to build a complex portfolio, as defined here. The fund [JQUA](https://am.jpmorgan.com/us/en/asset-management/adv/products/jpmorgan-us-quality-factor-etf-46641q761) mentioned below is a good product, but I cannot recommend many of J.P. Morgan’s other funds. Other institutions have still more offerings, so this guide is not exhaustive. But the institutions reviewed here manage many of the best funds at very low cost. So unless you have highly specific ideas beyond indexing and want to use a product like Invesco’s [Solar ETF](https://www.invesco.com/us/financial-products/etfs/product-detail?audienceType=Investor&ticker=TAN), you are not missing anything major by selecting among them.

&nbsp;

## Comments on minor details and additional funds

BlackRock has an alternative to IUSV. This fund, [VLUE](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/251616/ishares-msci-usa-value-factor-etf), has a smaller number of holdings and a stronger value tilt than IUSV. It is expected to exaggerate the value premium, so it stands to reason that in the long run VLUE will probably outperform IUSV, with the drawback of higher volatility and higher random risk due to less diversification.

Vanguard’s US quality factor ETF (VFQY) is more balanced between small, mid, and large cap stocks than its counterpart at BlackRock (QUAL), which holds a smaller number of almost entirely large cap stocks. J.P. Morgan has a quality factor ETF with characteristics intermediate between the two ([JQUA](https://am.jpmorgan.com/us/en/asset-management/adv/products/jpmorgan-us-quality-factor-etf-46641q761)).

State Street doesn’t offer an ETF focused solely on the quality factor, but it does offer multiple ETFs such as [QUS](https://www.ssga.com/us/en/individual/etfs/funds/spdr-msci-usa-strategicfactorssm-etf-qus), [QEFA](https://www.ssga.com/us/en/individual/etfs/funds/spdr-msci-eafe-strategicfactorssm-etf-qefa), and [QWLD](https://www.ssga.com/us/en/individual/etfs/funds/spdr-msci-world-strategicfactorssm-etf-qwld) with a combination of quality, value, and low volatility. Low volatility is advertised because it has strong historical returns, but these returns are explained by [other](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUbJ21WcUWA&ab_channel=BenFelix) [variables](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X21002051). A low-volatility strategy dovetails well with selecting high-profitability stocks. You might consider using these funds to achieve risk factor diversification more simply, although the methods of diversification are less clear than when implemented on your own.

One may wish to build a bespoke allocation of developed and emerging markets. This is not hard: ETF pairs for developed/emerging markets include [SCHF](https://www.schwabassetmanagement.com/products/schf)/[SCHE](https://www.schwabassetmanagement.com/products/sche) by Schwab, [VEA](https://investor.vanguard.com/etf/profile/overview/VEA)/[VWO](https://investor.vanguard.com/etf/profile/VWO) by Vanguard, [IDEV](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/286762/ishares-core-msci-international-developed-markets-etf-fund)/[IEMG](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/244050/ishares-core-msci-emerging-markets-etf) by BlackRock, and [SPDW](https://www.ssga.com/us/en/individual/etfs/funds/spdr-portfolio-developed-world-ex-us-etf-spdw)/[SPEM](https://www.ssga.com/us/en/individual/etfs/funds/spdr-portfolio-emerging-markets-etf-spem) by State Street. (The fees are notably lower for these two from State Street than for CWI.) The mutual fund pairs are [FSPSX](https://fundresearch.fidelity.com/mutual-funds/summary/315911727)/[FPADX](https://fundresearch.fidelity.com/mutual-funds/summary/316146331) and [VTMGX](https://investor.vanguard.com/mutual-funds/profile/VTMGX)/[VEMAX](https://investor.vanguard.com/mutual-funds/profile/VEMAX).

Keep in mind that: (1) if a primary concern is market cap weighting, developed markets are a larger class and (even without the US) demand two to three times more weight than emerging markets; (2) the international value ETFs — AVDV, ISVL, IVLU, FIVA — invest exclusively in developed countries; and (3) emerging markets [do not always permit](https://www.fidelity.com/learning-center/investment-products/etf/etfs-tax-efficiency) the same tax efficiency for ETFs as other indices do, so they are more suitable for tax-advantaged investing. Unlike the international value ETFs, VTRIX provides some coverage of emerging markets.

Some of the Vanguard bond ETFs have a mutual fund counterpart with a purchase fee (also known as a front-end load). Those mutual funds are excluded for that reason; other Vanguard bond ETFs lack a mutual fund counterpart. Fidelity bond funds are omitted completely because their expense ratios are too high.

The only recommended funds not categorized in the tables above are J.P. Morgan's US quality ETF ([JQUA](https://am.jpmorgan.com/us/en/asset-management/adv/products/jpmorgan-us-quality-factor-etf-46641q761)) and US large cap value ETF ([JVAL](https://am.jpmorgan.com/us/en/asset-management/adv/products/jpmorgan-u-s-value-factor-etf-etf-shares-46641q753)); BlackRock's US large cap value fund ([VLUE](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/251616/ishares-msci-usa-value-factor-etf)) with greater value tilt than IUSV; and some Schwab funds that don't fit neatly into the table: their RAFI total US ETF ([FNDB](https://www.schwabassetmanagement.com/products/fndb)), US RAFI large cap funds ([FNDX](https://www.schwabassetmanagement.com/products/fndx)/[SFLNX](https://www.schwabassetmanagement.com/products/sflnx)), and RAFI emerging markets funds ([FNDE](https://www.schwabassetmanagement.com/products/fnde)/[SFENX](https://www.schwabassetmanagement.com/products/sfenx)).

## Example portfolio

This example portfolio is for a hypothetical married couple, both age 35 and earning income, with no debt and a combined liquid net worth of $40,000 plus a total of $10,000 in their Roth IRAs. They keep $20,000 in cash or bonds, $20,000 in stocks, and all $10,000 of retirement money in stocks. Some indices are duplicated, because investing in their taxable brokerage account and Roth IRA must be separate. When indices were repeated, I took the opportunity to select different funds, in order to dilute the idiosyncratic features of each manager's implementation (VFQY/QUAL; VBR/FISVX; AVDV/ISVL).
