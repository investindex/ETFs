For ETFs and mutual funds separately, I will propose portfolios with increasing levels of complexity and provide options from multiple institutions. If an institution lacks a fund to fill a given row's category, it will either be left blank or filled in with a suggested fund from another institution. The simplest portfolios are a single fund: a total US fund, a total global fund, or in the case of ETFs, a global multifactor fund. [Summary tables](https://github.com/investindex/Funds#summary) at the end organize all the funds, followed by an [example portfolio](https://github.com/investindex/Funds#example-portfolio) of specific stock and bond funds.

A terminology note: when used here in reference to a fund, the term _Global_ includes the US. The term _International_, abbreviated _Intl_, excludes the US.

&nbsp;

## ETFs

The ETF issuers with the largest total [assets under management](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/aum.asp) are BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Street (in decreasing order). The [ETF database](https://etfdb.com/etfs/issuers/#issuer-power-rankings__aum&sort_name=revenue_position&sort_order=asc&page=1) and [ETF.com](https://www.etf.com/channels/) are great resources for comparing and searching for ETFs. Regardless of your choice, the fees are a matter of cents annually for every $100 invested.

## Mutual funds

The leading providers of indexed mutual funds are Fidelity and Vanguard; Schwab has a smaller collection but also covers some indices which the first two do not (see RAFI indices in the [previous section](https://github.com/investindex/Portfolio)). Mutual fund offerings are not as diverse, so even the complex portfolio is not as complex as the ETF version. As with ETFs, annual fees are pennies per year for every $100 invested.

## General comments

Although the funds are presented as groups, there is no prize for brand loyalty and you may want to choose a combination of managing institutions, as well as a combination of ETFs and mutual funds. Other institutions I haven’t mentioned have solid offerings which are not diverse enough to build a complex portfolio at low cost, as defined here. So this guide is not exhaustive. But the institutions reviewed here manage many of the best funds at very low cost. Unless you have highly specific ideas beyond indexing, you are not missing anything major by selecting among them.

See this footnote<sup id="fn1">[1](#f1)</sup> for comments on minor details of funds, as well as many additional funds. Some of the new funds mentioned are multifactor funds, which combine the implementation of several factors in one fund.

&nbsp; 

The only previously mentioned bond funds not included in the summary table are BlackRock's short-term, high-yield bond fund ([SHYG](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/258100/ishares-05-year-high-yield-corporate-bond-etf)), Invesco's aggregate US bond fund ([PBND](https://www.invesco.com/us/financial-products/etfs/product-detail?audienceType=Investor&ticker=PBND)), and Invesco's ultrashort-term US treasury bond fund ([CLTL](https://www.invesco.com/us/financial-products/etfs/product-detail?audienceType=Investor&ticker=CLTL)). Fidelity bond funds are omitted completely because their expense ratios are too high. Some of the Vanguard bond ETFs have a mutual fund counterpart with a purchase fee (also known as a front-end load). Those mutual funds are excluded for that reason; other Vanguard bond ETFs lack a mutual fund counterpart.

Three of the emptiest stock fund rows are US Quality, Intl Quality, and Intl Small Cap Value. There are additional US Quality funds managed by Invesco ([SPHQ](https://www.invesco.com/us/financial-products/etfs/product-detail?audienceType=Investor&ticker=SPHQ)/[XMHQ](https://www.invesco.com/us/financial-products/etfs/product-detail?audienceType=Investor&ticker=XMHQ)/[XSHQ](https://www.invesco.com/us/financial-products/etfs/product-detail?audienceType=Investor&ticker=XSHQ)) and J.P. Morgan ([JQUA](https://am.jpmorgan.com/us/en/asset-management/adv/products/jpmorgan-us-quality-factor-etf-46641q761)); an Intl Quality fund managed by Invesco ([IDHQ](https://www.invesco.com/us/financial-products/etfs/product-detail?audienceType=Investor&ticker=IDHQ)); and Intl Small Cap Value funds managed by Avantis ([AVDV](https://www.avantisinvestors.com/content/avantis/en/investments/avantis-international-small-cap-value-etf.html)) and Invesco ([PDN](https://www.invesco.com/us/financial-products/etfs/product-detail?audienceType=Investor&ticker=PDN)). PDN actually invests in both small and mid cap stocks, which is valuable because no other fund offers exposure to mid cap equity in developed markets. It provides value tilt through RAFI weighting. However, its expense ratio is somewhat high for developed markets at .49%.

There are also the all-in-one funds [discussed in the guidelines](https://github.com/investindex/Guidelines#simplify-dont-oversimplify) and the additional funds discussed in the footnote.

## Example portfolio

These examples are for a hypothetical married couple, both age 35 and earning income, who rent their residence and have no debt. Their combined liquid net worth is $40,000 plus $10,000 in a Roth IRA one of them has contributed to. In the complex version, they keep $20,000 in cash and bonds and the remainder in stocks. Some indices are duplicated, because their taxable brokerage account and Roth IRA must be separate. When duplication was needed, I took the opportunity to select different funds, in order to average across differences in implementation. In the simple version, they keep about $20,800 in cash and bonds and the remainder in stocks. Only three funds are used, instead of 15. They approach two poles of a spectrum of complexity; many people would choose an intermediate number of funds.

#### Additional funds and minor comments<sup id="f1"> 1 </sup>

When deciding on weights for developed vs. emerging markets, keep in mind that: (1) if a primary concern is market cap weighting, developed markets are a larger class and (even without the US) demand two to three times more weight than emerging markets; and (2) all the international single-factor funds invest exclusively in developed countries, except VTRIX which provides some coverage of emerging markets as well.

Unlike the other managers, BlackRock includes South Korea in their emerging markets fund (IEMG) instead of their developed markets fund (IDEV). This also applies to their emerging markets small cap fund ([EEMS](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/239642/ishares-msci-emerging-markets-smallcap-etf)), which includes South Korea while its counterpart at State Street ([EWX](https://www.ssga.com/us/en/individual/etfs/funds/spdr-sp-emerging-markets-small-cap-etf-ewx)) does not. If you choose to use EEMS or EWX, it would be best to pair it with country coverage in mind. AVDV and ISVL exclude South Korea but FNDC and PDN include it, so EEMS pairs well with AVDV or ISVL and EWX pairs with FNDC or PDN. A portfolio with AVDV and EWX would miss out on small cap South Korean stocks, and one with PDN and EEMS would double up on them.

Avantis has a suite of [core holdings](https://www.avantisinvestors.com/content/avantis/en/investments.html) as both ETFs and mutual funds. Their US small cap value ETF ([AVUV](https://www.avantisinvestors.com/content/avantis/en/investments/avantis-u-s-small-cap-value-etf.html)) is featured in the simple version of the example portfolio above.

Vanguard’s US quality factor ETF (VFQY) is more balanced between small, mid, and large cap stocks than its counterpart at BlackRock (QUAL), which holds a smaller number of almost entirely large cap stocks. J.P. Morgan's quality factor ETF has characteristics intermediate between the two ([JQUA](https://am.jpmorgan.com/us/en/asset-management/adv/products/jpmorgan-us-quality-factor-etf-46641q761)). The only other fund by J.P. Morgan I can recommend is their large cap value fund ([JVAL](https://am.jpmorgan.com/us/en/asset-management/adv/products/jpmorgan-u-s-value-factor-etf-etf-shares-46641q753)).

BlackRock has an alternative to IUSV. This fund, [VLUE](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/251616/ishares-msci-usa-value-factor-etf), has a smaller number of holdings and a stronger value tilt than IUSV. It is expected to exaggerate the value premium, so it stands to reason that in the long run VLUE will probably outperform IUSV, with the drawback of higher volatility and higher random risk due to less diversification.

Some Schwab funds don't fit neatly into the summary table: their RAFI total US ETF ([FNDB](https://www.schwabassetmanagement.com/products/fndb)), RAFI US large cap funds ([FNDX](https://www.schwabassetmanagement.com/products/fndx)/[SFLNX](https://www.schwabassetmanagement.com/products/sflnx)), and RAFI emerging markets funds ([FNDE](https://www.schwabassetmanagement.com/products/fnde)/[SFENX](https://www.schwabassetmanagement.com/products/sfenx)).

#### Multifactor funds

State Street doesn’t offer an ETF focused solely on the quality factor, but it does offer multiple ETFs with a combination of quality, value, and low volatility: [QUS](https://www.ssga.com/us/en/individual/etfs/funds/spdr-msci-usa-strategicfactorssm-etf-qus), [QEFA](https://www.ssga.com/us/en/individual/etfs/funds/spdr-msci-eafe-strategicfactorssm-etf-qefa), [QEMM](https://www.ssga.com/us/en/individual/etfs/funds/spdr-msci-emerging-markets-strategicfactorssm-etf-qemm), and [QWLD](https://www.ssga.com/us/en/individual/etfs/funds/spdr-msci-world-strategicfactorssm-etf-qwld). Low volatility is advertised because it has strong historical returns, but these returns are explained by [other](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUbJ21WcUWA&ab_channel=BenFelix) [variables](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X21002051). A low-volatility strategy dovetails well with selecting high-profitability stocks.

There are other [multifactor funds](https://www.msci.com/msci-diversified-multi-factor-indexes) which I will list here. You might consider using these funds to achieve risk factor diversification more simply, although the methods of diversification are less clear than when implemented on your own. Expense ratios are slightly higher but still reasonable. If the funds listed here present an overwhelming number of choices, simply ignore them and keep reading.

BlackRock manages a global multifactor fund ([ACWF](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/272821/ishares-msci-global-multi-factor-etf)), a developed markets multifactor fund ([INTF](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/272822/ishares-msci-international-multi-factor-etf)), an emerging markets multifactor fund ([EMGF](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/272820/ishares-msci-emerging-multi-factor-etf)), an international developed small cap multifactor fund ([ISCF](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/272823/ishares-msci-international-small-cap-multi-factor-etf)), a US small cap multifactor fund ([SMLF](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/272825/ishares-msci-usa-small-cap-multi-factor-etf)), a US mid cap multifactor fund ([MIDF](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/308876/)), and a US large cap multifactor fund ([LRGF](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/272824/ishares-msci-usa-multi-factor-etf)).

Pimco manages a RAFI US multifactor fund ([MFUS](https://www.pimco.com/en-us/investments/etf/rafi-dynamic-multi-factor-us-equity-etf)), a RAFI developed markets multifactor fund ([MFDX](https://www.pimco.com/en-us/investments/etf/rafi-dynamic-multi-factor-international-equity-etf)), and a RAFI emerging markets multifactor fund ([MFEM](https://www.pimco.com/en-us/investments/etf/rafi-dynamic-multi-factor-emerging-markets-equity-etf)).

Goldman Sachs manages a US large cap multifactor fund ([GSLC](https://www.gsam.com/content/gsam/us/en/individual/products/etf-fund-finder/goldman-sachs-activebeta-u-s--large-cap-equity-etf.html)), a US small cap multifactor fund ([GSSC](https://www.gsam.com/content/gsam/us/en/advisors/fund-center/etf-fund-finder/goldman-sachs-activebeta-u-s--small-cap-equity-etf.html)), a developed markets multifactor fund ([GSIE](https://www.gsam.com/content/gsam/us/en/individual/products/etf-fund-finder/goldman-sachs-activebeta-international-equity-etf.html)), and an emerging markets multifactor fund ([GEM](https://www.gsam.com/content/gsam/us/en/individual/products/etf-fund-finder/goldman-sachs-activebeta-emerging-markets-equity-etf.html)). Despite the ActiveBeta label, they are passively managed like all funds discussed here.

Invesco manages a US large cap multifactor fund ([QVML](https://www.invesco.com/us/financial-products/etfs/product-detail?audienceType=Investor&productId=ETF-QVML)), a US mid cap multifactor fund ([QVMM](https://www.invesco.com/us/financial-products/etfs/product-detail?audienceType=Investor&productId=ETF-QVMM)), and a US small cap multifactor fund ([QVMS](https://www.invesco.com/us/financial-products/etfs/product-detail?audienceType=Investor&productId=ETF-QVMS)).

Fidelity manages a developed markets multifactor fund ([FDEV](https://institutional.fidelity.com/app/fund/etf/snapshot/FIIS_ETF_FDEV.html)), an emerging markets multifactor fund ([FDEM](https://institutional.fidelity.com/app/fund/etf/snapshot/FIIS_ETF_FDEM.html)), a US large cap multifactor fund ([FLRG](https://institutional.fidelity.com/app/fund/etf/snapshot/FIIS_ETF_FLRG.html)), and a US small/mid cap multifactor fund ([FSMD](https://institutional.fidelity.com/app/fund/etf/snapshot/FIIS_ETF_FSMD.html)).
